- #### Marketplace description
	- ##### The mission of our web site will be to give every artist all over the wolrd the possibility to share their art in a decentralized online marketplace. We will build a tool that will connect artists and collectors at first hand. 
	- ##### As we said before, of course our main target will be collectors and artists. Nevertheless, we trust in the virtue of the our web site. So we hope its extension will lead more and more people to be intrigued by this technologies and find their own motivation to become either artists or collectors 
- #### Group Members
	- ##### Francisco Alamino 
		- ###### I'm an ilutrador and concept artist. I like to create new worlds and develop all kinds of ideas. The best part of a project is doing it.
	- ##### Ramiro Fernandez
		- ###### Crypto enthusiast, curious & technology geek.
	- ##### Juli√°n Rosenfeld 
		- ###### Currently studying electronic engineering, HUGE FAN (almost hooligan) of Boca Juniors and a great, but amateur, football player. I'm also an average musician. 
- #### Reference Web sites
	- ##### [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)
		- Opensea is our leading inspiration. Not only because is the most known NFT marketplace, but because it has a wonderful and very userfriendly design
	- ##### [Rarible](https://rarible.com/)
		- Another main site for NFT transactions is Rarible. Opensea and Rarible share a modern design, with the slight difference that rarible has a more juevenile design. Furthermore, it shows all the top seller of the day, week and month.
	- ##### [Super Rare](https://superrare.co/)
		- We didn't like the UX of SuperRare, at least at a first impression. But, we found in their web site some blogs and an editoral that are very useful for the final users.
	- ##### [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/)
		- From all the web sites listed up to now, none of them have a login/register process. This due to the fact that most of NFT markteplaces let users connect their own crypto wallets to the web site. On the contrary, in order to buy or sell NFTs in Nifty Gateway, having an account is mandatory. And of course, being logged in is also a requirement. 
	- ##### [Crypto|NFT](https://crypto.com/nft/marketplace)
		- Crypto, among other projects, has a NFT marketplace. Most of their services (like exchanges for margin trading, Earns, etc) were developed on a mobile app. But recently they have developed a web site for NFT commercialization. We believe that Cyrpto will be a perfect inspiration if we want to take our project to next level.
